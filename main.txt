WHAT IS CI/CD PIPELINE
Pipeline is a set of processes that take 
the code from version control and build,
compile, test and deploy to production
in automated fashion. The pipeline breaks
down the software delivery process into stages.
Each stage is made of different tasks
which can be carried out in parallel.
When all tasks in a stage passes, 
next stage is triggered.
The CI/CD pipeline is one of the best 
practices for DevOps teams to implement,
for delivering code changes more frequently and reliably.

MAIN GOAL OF THE CI/CD is providing 
shorter release cycle. So, end users 
can get new version of application
with new features of fixed bugs and
better application.
